#                                          PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AT SUPERMARKET
  
  A supermarket is an expansive retail fa  cility carrying a wide range of products under one roof, including full groceries lines and general merchandise. In theory, supermarkets allow customers to satisfy all their routine shopping needs in one trip. This project has all the basic and necessary functions that is involved in the working of product management software. The user can choose from a number of features such as add product(s), modify product(s) with the help of various unique identifiers, delete product(s), or simply search product(s).
 
###  Technology/Framework used:
    C++(programming language)
    
###  System Requirements:
    Application: Borland Turbo C++ (v3.0) 
    Application Version: 3.0
    
###  Features:
This program is a working model of a product management system at a supermarket and therefore has the basic and necessary functionality of managing products. It consists of six operations the user can choose from:
 
    1. Add A New Product: 
       The user can choose this option to add a new product in the file by feeding information such as the product code, product name, product quantity and product price.
    
    2. Show All The Products: 
       The user can choose to view all the existing products parameters of the file such as product code, product name, product quantity and product price in a tabular format.
    
    3. Check For Product Availability: 
       The user can choose this option to manually find a particular product using the unique parameters of the product, i.e. product code and product name.
    
    4. Modify A Product: 
       The user can choose this option to manually find a particular product using the unique parameters of the product, i.e. product code and product name and then change the other parameters of the product such as product name, product quantity and product price except the product code.
    
    5. Delete A Product: 
       The user can choose this option to manually find a particular product using the unique parameters of the product, i.e. product code and product name and then delete the entire record corresponding to that particular product.
  
  The program also has a **taxation** function which calculates the tax of a particular product at a time and adds the tax amount to the price of the product thus making tax calculations more efficient.
  
  Moreover, the program launches a **login** interruption at the starting of the program to provide security to the user and to bar unauthenticated people from unauthorised access to the core of the program.
